# Brain_Tumor_Detection
This is a web app that uses Machine Learning to determine whether or not a person has brain tumor.
The notebook for the model training process is also in this repository.
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network model trained using Tensorflow and python.
I employed transfer learning technique using tensorflow's built-in VGG16 algorithm with pretrained weights.
