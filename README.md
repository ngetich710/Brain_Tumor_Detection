# Brain tumor detection

- This is a streamlit web app that uses Machine Learning to determine whether or not a person has brain tumors.
- The notebook for the model training process is also in this repository.
- The model is a convolutional neural network model trained using TensorFlow and Python.
- I employed transfer learning technique using TensorFlow's built-in VGG16 algorithm with pretrained weights.

## Use case

I believe this model is important in situations or areas where there are fewer doctors or radiology specialists with expertise in brain tumor detection
